## Instructions

This code is for a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, as well as square roots, cube roots, and percentages. It also has a history tab that saves the last 10 calculations you performed.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply enter your calculation into the input field and click the corresponding button. The answer will be displayed in the output field. You can also use the clear button to clear the input field and start over.

To use the history tab, click on the trash can icon. This will clear the history and remove all saved calculations.

## Code Explanation

The code for the calculator is written in JavaScript. It uses the DOM to create the user interface and the Intl.NumberFormat() function to format the output. The history tab is implemented using a local storage variable.
